# PLV
This repository contains the code for Phase Locking Value (PLV) analysis using EEG data. The project was developed during an internship at CMC Vellore. The code utilizes MNE, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries to perform PLV calculations between selected EEG channels, visualize the results, and compute overall and time-specific PLV values.
